### A CNN cat-dog classifier. Since the last update it:
* reaches 85% accuracy on the validation set.
* new convolution layer is added
* new hidden layer is added
* dropout rates are increased
* there is a bit which saves the weights of the model

### In the next release expect:
* Add an option to load a photo and let the classifier actually classify it.
This will be new as for now all the model is doing is testing and validation.
* Load the model's weights.
